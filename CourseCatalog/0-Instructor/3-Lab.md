#Lab
The goal of these steps of the lab exercise is to demonstrate adding background saving of Core Data objects using data from a network call.


* Save using the root saving context
* merge changes to the main UI context using NSNotifications
* add a progress bar to importing

* Data isn't saved to store
 * Add recursive save call
* Show course detail view
 * Have single course detail download/update in background using the CoreDataStack object (without {the evil} singleton pattern!)
